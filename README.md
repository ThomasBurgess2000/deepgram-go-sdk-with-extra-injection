## Getting an API Key

üîë To access the Deepgram API you will need a [free Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).

## Installation

To incorporate this SDK into your project's `go.mod` file, run the following command from your repo:

```bash
go get github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk
```

## Requirements

[Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (version ^1.19)

## Quickstarts

This SDK aims to reduce complexity and abtract/hide some internal Deepgram details that clients shouldn't need to know about.  However you can still tweak options and settings if you need.

### PreRecorded Audio Transcription Quickstart

You can find a [walkthrough](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/pre-recorded-audio-transcription) on our documentation site. Transcribing Pre-Recorded Audio can be done using the following sample code:

```go
// context
ctx := context.Background()

//client
c := client.NewWithDefaults()
dg := prerecorded.New(c)

// transcription options
options := &interfaces.PreRecordedTranscriptionOptions{
    Punctuate:  true,
    Diarize:    true,
    Language:   "en-US",
}

// send URL
URL := "https://my-domain.com/files/my-conversation.mp3"
res, err := dg.FromURL(ctx, URL, options)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("FromURL failed. Err: %v\n", err)
}
```

### Live Audio Transcription Quickstart

You can find a [walkthrough](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/live-streaming-audio-transcription) on our documentation site. Transcribing Live Audio can be done using the following sample code:

```go
// options
transcriptOptions := &interfaces.LiveTranscriptionOptions{
    Language:    "en-US",
    Punctuate:   true,
    Encoding:    "linear16",
    Channels:    1,
    Sample_rate: 16000,
}

// create a callback for transcription messages
// for example, you can take a look at this example project:
// https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/streaming/microphone/main.go

// create the client
dgClient, err := client.NewWithDefaults(ctx, transcriptOptions, callback)
if err != nil {
    log.Println("ERROR creating LiveTranscription connection:", err)
    return
}

// call connect!
wsconn := dgClient.Connect()
if wsconn == nil {
    log.Println("Client.Connect failed")
    os.Exit(1)
}
```

## Examples

There are examples for **every*- API call in this SDK. You can find all of these examples in the [examples folder](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/tree/main/examples) at the root of this repo.

These examples provide:

Speech-to-Text: PreRecorded Audio:

- From an URL - [examples/prerecorded/url](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/prerecorded/url/main.go)
- From an Audio Stream - [examples/prerecorded/stream](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/prerecorded/stream/main.go)

Speech-to-Text: Live Audio:

- From a Microphone - [examples/streaming/microphone](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/streaming/microphone/main.go)
- From an HTTP Endpoint - [examples/streaming/http](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/streaming/http/main.go)

Text-to-Speech

- Save audio to a Path - [examples/speak/save](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/speak/save/main.go)
- Save audio to a user-defined Writer - [examples/speak/file](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/speak/file/main.go)
- Save audio to a Stream/Buffer - [examples/speak/stream](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/speak/stream/main.go)

Management API exercise the full [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations for:

- Balances - [examples/manage/balances](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/manage/balances/main.go)
- Invitations - [examples/manage/invitations](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/manage/invitations/main.go)
- Keys - [examples/manage/keys](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/manage/keys/main.go)
- Members - [examples/manage/members](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/manage/members/main.go)
- Projects - [examples/manage/projects](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/manage/projects/main.go)
- Scopes - [examples/manage/scopes](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/manage/scopes/main.go)
- Usage - [examples/manage/usage](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/manage/usage/main.go)

To run each example set the `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` as an environment variable, then `cd` into each example folder and execute the example: `go run main.go`.

## Logging

This SDK provides logging as a means to troubleshoot and debug issues encountered. By default, this SDK will enable `Information` level messages and higher (ie `Warning`, `Error`, etc) when you initialize the library as follows:

```go
client.InitWithDefault();
```

To increase the logging output/verbosity for debug or troubleshooting purposes, you can set the `TRACE` level but using this code:

```go
// init library
client.Init(client.InitLib{
    LogLevel: client.LogLevelTrace,
})
```

## Testing

TBD

## Backwards Compatibility

Older SDK versions will receive Priority 1 (P1) bug support only. Security issues, both in our code and dependencies, are promptly addressed. Significant bugs without clear workarounds are also given priority attention.
